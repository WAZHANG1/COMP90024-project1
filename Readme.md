To run our script, there are several libraries needed to install first:
pandas, numpy, shaply, mpi4py

Since we have written the "bigtwitter" file name within the input line, it only needs to put the .py, .slurm and big tweeter file in the same folder. 

Run each of the .slurm script by using sbatch and monitor the job process by using squeue command in sparten.
